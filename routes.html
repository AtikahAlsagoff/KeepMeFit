          <p style="color:#F3D5CD;" class="paragraph"> 3. Southern Bump </p>
          <p style="color:#ffc4b3;" class="text">The Southern Bump Track, one of the most demanding cycling tracks, is suitable for gung-ho cyclists. It consists of a route filled with small yet sharp hills including a slope as high as 17% on Vigilante Drive — Singapore’s sharpest gradient. Keep your fingers prepared at the brakes for this route as you wouldn’t want to be rolling back two metres for every metre travelled up on Mount Faber. An astonishing sight of lush greenery can also be seen from atop Henderson Waves and Forest Walk. Although challenging, this track is worth a try!</p>
